# booklist-app
In this branch, I included static methods; getBooks(), displayBooks(), addBook() and removeBook(). I tried to set books which have been added to the list to Local Storage so that on reload, the books which have been added would not be lost.

However, when I reloaded the web page, this did not turn out as expected as I kept on getting an error which said the title property of book could not be read.
